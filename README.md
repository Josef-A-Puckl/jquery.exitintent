jQuery Exit Intent Plugin
=========================

The jQuery Exit Intent plugin try to anticipate when the user is about
to leave the current page, and fire an event when it thinks they are
doing so. You can react to this event to display modal dialogues,
change page text, etc., to try to grab user's attention and
(hopefully) made them change their minds.


Requirements
------------

1. jQuery >= 1.4


Installation
------------

1. Download the plugin

2. Include the following line *after* jQuery:

        <script src="jquery.exitintent.min.js"></script>

   NB: adjust the path as necessary

3. Enable the plugin in your site:

        $.exitIntent('enable');

4. Listen to the `exitintent` event, and act accordingly:

        $(document).on('exitintent',
            function() {
                console.log('Oops... trying to leave the page');
            });


FAQ
---

1. How do I display a modal popup when the user is trying to leave my
page?

   This plugin only deals with detecting when the user is leaving the
   page, and triggering the `exitintent` event. It's up to you do
   define *what* you want to do when the user is leaving. For example,
   if you want to display a modal dialog, you may use your preferred
   jQuery modal plugin to display the modal.
